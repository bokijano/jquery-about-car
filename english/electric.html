          Electric cars are the future of the auto industry
        </h3>
        <p>
          Automotive companies are preparing for a future in which sales of
          electric vehicles will be higher than sales of vehicles with internal
          combustion engines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another automotive company confirmed that the future of the auto
          industry belongs to electric vehicles - after Volvo recently announced
          that from 2019 all new models will have an electric or hybrid engine,
          now Huandai have announced a "change in production strategy" whose
          center will be in the future electric vehicles. The company's plans in
          the next few years include 3 plug-in hybrids and eight electric cars
          and construction the first factory for the production of exclusively
          electric vehicles that will allow them to develop a larger number of
          e-vehicles with a higher range.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next year, we can expect an electric version of the model SUV
          Kona, whose range with one battery charge is almost 400 km, and
          Hyundai's plans include the development of an electric limousine under
          its Genesis brand, which should be on the market in 2021 with a range
          of around 500 km which will compete with Tesla, but Robin Zhu, an
          automotive market analyst for the BBC, said that in the next four
          years we can expect further progress of Tesla batteries, and then the
          range of their cars will be even greater than today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Otherwise, Hyundai last year introduced its first fully electric car
          intended for the mass market - IONIQ, but as for most similar
          e-vehicles, its problem is a battery that is weaker than the cars from
          Tesla and General Motors and the range with one charge amounts about
          280 km.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a few years, we can expect that almost all automotive companies
          will have several models of electric and hybrid vehicles in offer -
          their price will then probably be more competitive (especially if
          countries continue to grant subsidies and privileges to their
          customers). Until then infrastructure should not be a problem as the
          number of charging stations will increase with increasing vehicle
          sales, while charging should be faster.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to data released by the International Energy Agency, last
          year over 750 thousand electric cars have been sold. Even though their
          share in relation to classic petrol and diesel engines is the highest
          in Norway, when it comes to specific figures, most cars were sold in
          China, which has occupied more than 40 percent of the global market.
