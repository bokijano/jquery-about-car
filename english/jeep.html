  <h3 class="fontThreeInterestingHeading">THEY ARE THE STRONGEST ON THE WORLD:Top five jeeps that cross all obstacles!</h3>
  <ul>
   <li class="list-look">Lada Niva</li>
   <p>In the first place we must find Lada Niva. This is a car that does not 
     have luxury attributes and may not look attractive like other cars, but this 
     car can really get on the "greasy banderage". We think that the perfect jeep must be ready for every obstacle, 
     and Lada Niva does not shake with the challenges. All the rest are extras that can not be.</p>

   <li class="list-look">Jeep Wrangler</li>
   <p>This is probably a true synonym for Jeep, and when someone remembers this name, this car comes to your mind. 
     Less luxurious but incredibly ready for travel through nature. This is a standard vehicle on Saharan trips 
     and expeditions around the jungle because this car is ready to cross over any obstacle. 
     This jeep is far more affordable than other jeeps and can be yours for about $ 23,000.</p>

   <li class="list-look">Land Rover Range Rover</li>
   <p>The UK representative is always on the top lists for jeeps, which is for good reason. Very reliable and 
     offers great performance. It's excellent on the highway and also good on sandy and muddy roads. Multi-option 
     options offer you to install it to suit your needs and with this vehicle everyone will feel like 
     an adventurer. Naturally, the price is also high and is $ 85,000.</p>

   <li class="list-look">Toyota Land Cruiser</li>
   <p>A brilliant Jeep that has a phenomenal aggregate that will never let you down. It may be less luxurious 
     than Mercedes, but that's why the price is lower and it costs around $ 80,000. Land Cruiser is an incredible 
     terrain that will take you out of a loose gravel and deep mud, and even the flood will not stop you.</p>

   <li class="list-look">Mercedes-Benz G500</li>
   <p>The G500 is probably one of the most beautiful jeeps on the net and its high price of $ 115,000 clearly shows 
     this. This vehicle is very luxurious and will give you everything you want. The ride in this vehicle is 
     comfortable and insufficient. The G500 is a jeep that will easily drive you through the city, but if you 
     decide to take it in an adventure on unspoilt roads, believe us that this car will also dominate.</p>
